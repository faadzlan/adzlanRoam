#+title: Webex
When listening to a Webex meeting using bluetooth earphones, sometimes you lose control over the volume. The workaround is as follows.

1) Right click on the sounds icon in the system tray
2) Open volume mixer
3) Select the correct device under "Device"
4) Then, under "Applications", adjust the volume (in this case, "Applications" will be "Cisco Webex Service")

   And you should regain control over your volume.
