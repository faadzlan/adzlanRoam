#+title: LibreOffice Draw
To draw a freehand polygon in Draw, use the polygon drawing tool. You may encounter a situation where you are unable to change the line colour, thickness, type, etc. after drawing the freehand polygon. But to overcome this, you just need to select the drawing and press C-s similar to when you're saving  a document. Doing so, the option to tweak line properties becomes active and you're able to once again set your line properties.

If you don't do this, then your only option is through the right-click menu and select "Edit Style". But this method will change the line property globally, not for the specific line selected.
